# Logistic-Regression-on-Breast-Cancer
## overview
This project implements a Logistic Regression Model using Python for binary classification. The model follows a structured pipeline, including data preprocessing, normalization, model training, and evaluation.

## My Conclusion
We have successfully built a Logistic Regression model using the Breast Cancer dataset to predict whether a cell is malignant or benign based on various measurements of its nucleus. The model achieved an accuracy of 98%, meaning it correctly predicts 98% of the total cases.

From the classification report:

Precision and Recall for both classes (malignant and benign) are high, indicating the model is well-balanced.

F1-score is also close to 1, proving the effectiveness of the model.

This model can be extremely useful for hospitals and medical professionals to quickly analyze cell samples and identify potential cancer cases with high confidence.
